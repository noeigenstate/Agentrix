// What the usage guide and the About page list for this release; the guide opens on it after an update.
// Each note is a short title and one detail line, both with their English at the end of electron/locales/en.json.
// A beta may mark its additions with group: "new"; the list then shows them under their own heading and the rest under "earlier betas".
// The first beta of a version has nothing earlier to set apart, so it carries no group and shows one list; a stable release carries none either.
